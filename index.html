	    <h2>What is <a href="https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/160477/onitama">Onitama</a>?</h2>
	    <p>Onitama is a two-player, perfect information abstract game with a random starting set-up. On a 5X5 board, both players start with five pawns. 
		The pawn in the middle is the master and the other four are pupils. 
		Each player is given two open cards that each display a possible move for any of his pieces. 
		A fifth card rests next to the board. 
		On a player’s turn, he chooses one of his cards and moves any of his pieces according to the chosen card and then replaces the card with the one in the middle. 
		As the second player moves, he takes the card that was played by the first player in the previous turn. 
		Moving onto one of the opponent’s pawns removes that pawn from the game. 
		Taking the opponent’s master pawn or moving your master pawn onto your opponent’s master pawn’s starting space wins you the game.</p>

	    <h2>What Influence Do Heuristic Functions Have On Decisions?</h2>
	    <p>Two heuristic functions were used to decide which board state has a better "value."
		Red pieces are assigned a positive value while blue pieces are assigned a negative value.
		Pawns have a value of one while the master pieces have a value of ten.</p>
		<p>The following two heuristic functions were used:</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>Heuristic Sum - The sum of all pieces on the board.</li>
		  <li>Heuristic Ratio - The ratio of red pieces on the board to blue pieces on the board</li>
		</ul>

	    <h2>Does Depth Actually Increase Win Rate?</h2>
	    <p>There is no pattern indicated in the data, but there definitely is a difference in win rate from depth one to depth two.</p>

	    <h2>What Can You Do With This Project?</h2>
	    <p>This project comes with the built in capabilities to test the efficiency of the Minimax search algorithm and decision trees for yourself. 
		More importantly, it comes with the ability to play the game against the AI and test your skills against it.
		The environment has been setup to do all of the work for you.</p>
		<p>Have fun! See how deep your tree can go before it becomes unbeatable.</p>
