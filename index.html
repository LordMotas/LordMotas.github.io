	    <h2>What is Onitama?</h2>
	    <p>Onitama is a two-player, perfect information abstract game with a random starting set-up. On a 5X5 board, both players start with five pawns. The pawn in the middle is the master and the other four are pupils. Each player is given two open cards that each display a possible move for any of his pieces. A fifth card rests next to the board. On a player’s turn, he chooses one of his cards and moves any of his pieces according to the chosen card and then replaces the card with the one in the middle. As the second player moves, he takes the card that was played by the first player in the previous turn. Moving onto one of the opponent’s pawns removes that pawn from the game. Taking the opponent’s master pawn or moving your master pawn onto your opponent’s master pawn’s starting space wins you the game.</p>
